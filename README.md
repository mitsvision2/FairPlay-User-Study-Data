# FairPlay User Study Data: Consensus-Driven Data Debiasing for Hiring Decisions

This repository contains the **FairPlay User Study Dataset**, which has been made publicly available to support transparency and reproducibility in research. The dataset is a part of the FairPlay project, a tool designed for collaborative debiasing and fairness exploration in datasets.

## Contents

- `Fairplay.zip`: A compressed folder containing three subfolders, each corresponding to a user study. Each subfolder contains a separate CSV file for each FairPlay round.
  - **Userstudy 1**: User Study 1 with its corresponding CSV files for each round.
  - **Userstudy 2**: User Study 2 with its corresponding CSV files for each round.
  - **Userstudy 3**: User Study 3 with its corresponding CSV files for each round.
  
## Description

The dataset includes anonymized user study data used for analyzing collaborative fairness workflows. The data is structured to facilitate research and analysis for applications such as:
- Collaborative fairness evaluation.
- Stakeholder interactions in AI model development.
